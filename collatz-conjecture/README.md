## Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3x + 1 problem, is an unsolved mathematical problem in number theory. It is named after Lothar Collatz, who introduced the conjecture in 1937. The conjecture is defined as follows:

1. Start with any positive integer \( n \).
2. If \( n \) is even, divide it by 2.
3. If \( n \) is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Repeat the process with the resulting number.

The conjecture asserts that no matter what initial value of \( n \) is chosen, the sequence will eventually reach the number 1.

### Example

For \( n = 6 \):

- 6 is even; divide by 2 to get 3.
- 3 is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 10.
- 10 is even; divide by 2 to get 5.
- 5 is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 to get 16.
- 16 is even; divide by 2 to get 8.
- 8 is even; divide by 2 to get 4.
- 4 is even; divide by 2 to get 2.
- 2 is even; divide by 2 to get 1.

Thus, starting from 6, the sequence reaches 1 after a series of steps.

### Generalized Collatz Sequences

Variations of the Collatz conjecture involve different linear transformations applied to odd numbers. For example:

- **5x + 1 Sequence**: If \( n \) is odd, multiply by 5 and add 1.
- **kx Â± 1 Sequence**: For a fixed positive integer \( k \), if \( n \) is odd, multiply by \( k \) and either add or subtract 1.

These generalized sequences may exhibit different behaviors and are subjects of mathematical interest.
