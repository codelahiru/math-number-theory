# Number Theory Overview

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of integers and integer-valued functions. It is often referred to as "higher arithmetic" and involves the exploration of the properties and relationships of numbers, especially integers.

## Key Areas in Number Theory

### Elementary Number Theory
- **Prime Numbers**: Study of primes (numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves) and their distribution.
- **Divisibility**: Rules and properties of divisibility among integers.
- **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: Concepts related to the common factors of integers.
- **Congruences**: Modular arithmetic and congruence relations.

### Analytic Number Theory
- **Prime Number Theorem**: Describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers.
- **Riemann Hypothesis**: Conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers.
- **Dirichlet's Theorem on Arithmetic Progressions**: Conditions under which arithmetic progressions contain infinitely many primes.

### Algebraic Number Theory
- **Algebraic Numbers**: Numbers that are roots of non-zero polynomial equations with integer coefficients.
- **Field Extensions**: Study of how number fields can be extended.
- **Class Number Theory**: Investigates the structure of the class group of a number field.

### Diophantine Equations
- **Equations**: Polynomial equations where the solutions are restricted to integers.
- **Fermat's Last Theorem**: States that no three positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can satisfy \(a^n + b^n = c^n\) for any integer value of \(n > 2\).

### Transcendental Number Theory
- **Transcendental Numbers**: Numbers that are not algebraic, i.e., not roots of any non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients (e.g., \(e\) and \(\pi\)).

### Cryptography
- Application of number theory in securing communication, notably through concepts like RSA encryption, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.

## Importance of Number Theory

1. **Foundational**: Many mathematical theories and results are grounded in number theory.
2. **Applications**: Widely used in cryptography, computer science, coding theory, and more.
3. **Historical Significance**: One of the oldest branches of mathematics, with problems dating back to ancient civilizations.

## Famous Problems and Theorems

1. **Fermat's Last Theorem**: Proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994.
2. **Goldbach Conjecture**: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes (still unproven).
3. **Twin Prime Conjecture**: There are infinitely many prime pairs \(p\) and \(p + 2\).

Number theory remains a vibrant and active field of research, continually contributing to advancements in mathematics and related disciplines.
